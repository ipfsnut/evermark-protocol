# Curation Voting

Evermark Protocol features a democratic voting system where community members use wEMARK tokens to curate content through seasonal voting cycles.

## Seasonal Voting System

### How It Works
- **Duration**: Admin-controlled seasonal periods 
- **Participation**: Open to all wEMARK token holders
- **Scope**: Vote on any existing Evermark NFT
- **Voting Power**: Based on current wEMARK balance

### Voting Process
1. **Hold wEMARK**: Stake EMARK tokens to get voting power (1:1 ratio)
2. **Cast Votes**: Directly vote for specific Evermarks using available voting power
3. **Track Usage**: Monitor how much voting power you've used in current season
4. **Season End**: New season starts when admin initiates it

## Direct Voting

### Mechanics
- **Vote Weight**: 1 wEMARK = 1 vote
- **Direct Casting**: Vote directly for Evermarks, no delegation system
- **Vote Tracking**: Used votes are tracked per user per season
- **Remaining Power**: Can only vote with unused voting power for current season

### Voting Rules
- **Total Limit**: Cannot exceed your total wEMARK balance in votes per season
- **Season Reset**: Voting power refreshes each new season
- **Flexible Distribution**: Split votes across multiple Evermarks as desired

### Strategy
- **Quality Focus**: Support Evermarks you believe deserve recognition
- **Power Management**: Distribute votes strategically across the season
- **Community Curation**: Help surface the best content through voting

## Leaderboard Integration

### Seasonal Rankings
- **Vote Tracking**: All votes are recorded on-chain per season
- **Evermark Scores**: Each Evermark accumulates votes throughout the season
- **Historical Data**: Previous season results are permanently stored
- **Community Recognition**: Top-voted content gains community validation

### Benefits for Creators
- **Democratic Validation**: Votes represent genuine community support
- **Permanent Record**: On-chain voting history provides credibility
- **Quality Signal**: Higher vote counts indicate community-valued content

## Reward Eligibility

Voting participation makes you eligible for rewards through the EvermarkRewards system:

### Participation Benefits
- **Staking Rewards**: wEMARK holders earn dual-token rewards (EMARK + WETH)
- **No Multipliers**: Rewards are based on proportional stake, not voting frequency
- **Automatic Eligibility**: Simply holding wEMARK makes you eligible for rewards
- **Compounding**: Earned EMARK can be restaked to increase future rewards

### Current Implementation
The system focuses on:
- Simple, direct voting without delegation complexity
- Proportional rewards based on stake size
- Seasonal cycles controlled by protocol administrators
- On-chain transparency for all voting activity
