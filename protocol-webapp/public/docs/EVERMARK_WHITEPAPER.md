## Introduction

In an era of information abundance and digital content proliferation, the challenge of preserving valuable content while filtering signal from noise has become increasingly critical. Traditional content platforms are centralized, subject to censorship, and vulnerable to data loss. Evermark addresses these limitations by creating a decentralized, community-governed platform for content preservation and curation.

Built on Base blockchain infrastructure, Evermark v2.0 leverages the immutability of blockchain technology, the permanence of ArDrive (Arweave) storage, and the wisdom of decentralized communities to create a robust content preservation ecosystem.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges in Digital Content

1. **Platform Dependency**: Content creators and curators rely on centralized platforms that can disappear, change policies, or restrict access
2. **Content Censorship**: Centralized authorities can remove or restrict access to valuable content
3. **Data Loss**: Server failures, platform closures, and technical issues can result in permanent content loss
4. **Quality Filtering**: The overwhelming volume of digital content makes it difficult to identify and preserve truly valuable material
5. **Incentive Misalignment**: Current platforms often prioritize engagement over quality, leading to suboptimal content curation

### The Need for Decentralized Solutions

- **Permanence**: Content should be preserved indefinitely without relying on any single entity
- **Censorship Resistance**: No central authority should have the power to remove or restrict access to content
- **Community Governance**: Content quality and importance should be determined by community consensus
- **Economic Incentives**: Contributors should be rewarded for their participation in content preservation and curation
- **Interoperability**: Preserved content should be accessible across different platforms and applications

## Solution Overview

Evermark solves these challenges through a multi-layered approach:

### Core Solution Components

1. **NFT-Based Content Preservation**: Content is permanently preserved by minting it as NFTs on the Base blockchain, with metadata and files stored on ArDrive (Arweave)
2. **Token-Based Voting System**: Community members stake $EMARK tokens to gain voting power and participate in content curation
3. **Reputation and Ranking**: A sophisticated leaderboard system ranks content based on community votes and engagement
4. **Permanent Storage**: Content files are stored on ArDrive (Arweave) ensuring true permanent availability with 200+ year data guarantees
5. **Season Management**: Automated weekly progression with oracle coordination and reward distribution
6. **Multi-Platform Access**: Support for web browsers, mobile devices, and Farcaster Frame integration

### Value Propositions

- **For Content Creators**: Permanent preservation of their work with potential for community recognition
- **For Curators**: Economic incentives for identifying and promoting valuable content
- **For Consumers**: Access to high-quality, community-curated content without platform restrictions
- **For the Ecosystem**: A sustainable model for long-term content preservation and quality improvement

## Technical Architecture

### Blockchain Infrastructure

├── evermarks.ts       // CRUD operations for evermarks
├── auth-wallet.ts     // Wallet authentication
├── auth-nonce.ts      // Authentication nonce generation
├── frame.ts           // Farcaster Frame support
├── shares.ts          // Social sharing features
├── webhook.ts         // External integrations
├── upload-image.ts    // ArDrive image upload proxy
└── dev-dashboard.ts   // Development utilities
```

### Storage Layer - ArDrive Primary Architecture

**ArDrive (Arweave) Integration**
- **Permanent Storage**: True permanent storage with 200+ year data guarantees
- **Supabase Caching**: Performance optimization for frequently accessed content
- **Legacy IPFS Support**: Backward compatibility for existing content
- **Cost Transparency**: Real-time storage cost estimation and monitoring

### Web3 Integration

**Thirdweb SDK v5**

- Frame Wagmi Connector for Farcaster integration
- Type-safe contract calls with automatic ABI generation

## Core Features

### 1. Content Preservation (Evermarks)

**NFT Minting System**
```typescript
interface Evermark {
  tokenId: number;
  title: string;
  author: string;
  creator: string;
  description: string;
  metadataURI: string;
  contentType: 'Article' | 'Blog' | 'Video' | 'Image' | 'Custom';
  sourceUrl?: string;
  tags: string[];
  verified: boolean;
  createdAt: string;
  votes: number;
  viewCount: number;
}
```

**Content Processing Pipeline:**
1. User submits content URL or uploads file
2. Content metadata extraction and validation
3. File upload to ArDrive for permanent storage
4. NFT minting on Base blockchain
5. Metadata storage in Supabase for fast access
6. Content indexing for search and discovery

### 2. Community Voting System

**Voting Mechanism**
```typescript
interface VotingSystem {
  stakeTokens(amount: bigint): Promise<TransactionResult>;
  delegateVotes(delegate: string): Promise<TransactionResult>;
  voteForEvermark(evermarkId: string, votes: bigint): Promise<TransactionResult>;
  getCurrentVotingPower(user: string): Promise<bigint>;
  getEvermarkVotes(evermarkId: string): Promise<bigint>;
}
```

**Voting Power Calculation:**
- Base voting power from staked $EMARK tokens
- Delegation system for concentrated expertise
- Time-weighted voting to prevent gaming
- Seasonal cycles for dynamic participation

### 3. Token Staking & Economics

**Staking System**
```typescript
interface StakingSystem {
  stake(amount: bigint, duration: number): Promise<TransactionResult>;
  unstake(stakeId: string): Promise<TransactionResult>;
  getStakingRewards(user: string): Promise<bigint>;
  calculateAPY(duration: number): Promise<number>;
}
```

**Economic Mechanisms:**
- **Staking Rewards**: Users earn rewards for long-term token commitment
- **Voting Multipliers**: Longer stakes provide increased voting power
- **Slashing Protection**: Gradual unlock periods prevent manipulation
- **Fee Distribution**: Platform fees distributed to stakers

### 4. Leaderboard & Reputation

**Ranking Algorithm**
```typescript
interface LeaderboardEntry {
  rank: number;
  evermarkId: string;
  totalVotes: bigint;
  voterCount: number;
  score: number;
  scoreMultiplier: number;
  trendingScore: number;
  momentum: 'up' | 'down' | 'stable';
  category: string;
  seasonNumber: number;
}
```

**Scoring Factors:**
- **Vote Weight**: Total voting power applied to content
- **Voter Diversity**: Number of unique voters
- **Time Decay**: Recent votes weighted more heavily
- **Category Balancing**: Prevents single-category dominance
- **Quality Signals**: Additional metrics for content assessment

### 5. Multi-Platform Integration

**Farcaster Frame Support**
```typescript
interface FrameIntegration {
  generateFrameMetadata(evermarkId: string): FrameMetadata;
  handleFrameInteraction(payload: FrameActionPayload): FrameResponse;
  authenticateFrameUser(fid: number): Promise<User>;
}
```

**Platform Features:**
- **Browser Application**: Full-featured web interface
- **Farcaster Frames**: Embedded interactions within Farcaster
- **Mobile PWA**: Progressive web app for mobile devices
- **API Access**: RESTful API for third-party integrations

interface BetaPoints {
  createEvermark: 10;      // Points per Evermark created
  vote: 1;                 // Points per vote transaction
  stake: 1;                // Points per 1M EMARK staked
  marketplaceBuy: 1;       // Points per NFT purchase
  marketplaceSell: 1;      // Points per NFT listing creation
  earlyAdopter: 50;        // Bonus for early participation
}
```

**Integration with $EMARK:**
- Beta points serve as additional rewards alongside $EMARK token incentives
