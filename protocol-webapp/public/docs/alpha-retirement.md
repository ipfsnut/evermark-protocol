# Alpha Retirement Notice

## Overview

The Evermark Alpha contracts have been officially retired and all user funds have been safely returned as liquid $EMARK tokens.

## What Happened to Alpha

The Alpha contracts were **experimental prototypes** designed to test the feasibility of the Evermark concept. After extensive testing and community feedback, we determined that the Alpha architecture had limitations that would prevent it from scaling effectively for long-term use. Alpha Evermark NFTs will no longer be supported, and the Alpha UI has been deprecated. 

The Alpha $EMARK staking contract was destroyed during an upgrade and all funds were lost. Due to the nature of the Alpha contracts, we are unable to recover any funds from the destroyed contract, but we are committed to returning all user funds from Alpha staking as liquid $EMARK tokens to the original stakers. Web3 is a rapidly evolving space, and we learned valuable lessons from the Alpha phase that will inform the future of Evermark, beginning with the Beta contracts--which have been designed to be more robust, secure, and user-friendly while also minimizing risk. Upgrade protocol can be followed correctly in the future and we will ensure that all future contracts are built with security and user experience in mind and a new, simplified architecture featuring a modular design that allows for easy upgrades without requiring fund migration.

### Key Alpha Limitations
- **Smart contract architecture** was not optimized for gas efficiency
- **Staking mechanics** had potential edge cases that could affect user experience  
- **Voting system** lacked the sophistication needed for effective content curation
- **Reward distribution** was overly complex and difficult to audit

## Fund Security & Refunds

**All user funds from Alpha staking will be returned.** If you had staked $EMARK tokens in the Alpha contracts:

- ‚úÖ Your staked tokens will be **manually refunded** as liquid $EMARK
- ‚è≥ Refunds are being processed individually by the dev (will be completed by 9/1/2025)
- ‚úÖ All refunds will be sent to the same wallet addresses used for staking
- ‚úÖ Your token balance will reflect the full amount you originally staked once processed
- ‚úÖ You will receive an Alpha Tester NFT as a token of appreciation for your support

### Checking Your Refund
1. Connect your wallet to the Beta application
2. View your $EMARK balance in the token dashboard
3. If you haven't received your refund yet, please reach out on our Farcaster channel
4. Your balance will include all previously staked Alpha tokens once processed

## Beta Contracts: Built to Last

The Beta contracts represent a **complete redesign** from the ground up, incorporating lessons learned from Alpha testing:

### Beta Improvements
- **Redesigned smart contract architecture** optimized for security and efficiency
- **Simplified staking mechanics** with clear unbonding periods
- **Sophisticated curation system** with voting power delegation and seasonal cycles
- **Transparent reward system** with predictable distribution mechanisms
- **Extensive testing** on multiple testnets before mainnet deployment

### Beta Testing Phase
The Beta contracts are currently **deployed on Base mainnet** and in testing phase:

- ‚úÖ Internal testing completed
- ‚úÖ Testnet validation completed
- ‚úÖ **Mainnet deployment completed** - Beta contracts are live
- ‚úÖ Community beta testing in progress
- ‚è≥ External security audit planned

## Transition Timeline

### Phase 1: Alpha Retirement ‚úÖ Complete
- Alpha contracts deactivated
- Alpha UI deprecated
- Manual refund process initiated

### Phase 2: Beta Deployment & Testing üîÑ Current
- ‚úÖ Beta contracts deployed to Base mainnet
- ‚úÖ Beta application launched and functional
- üîÑ Community testing and feedback collection in progress
- üîÑ Manual Alpha staker refunds being processed
- üîÑ Performance monitoring and optimization

### Phase 3: Beta Stabilization ‚è≥ Upcoming  
- External security audit
- Final contract optimizations based on testing feedback
- Complete Alpha refund processing
- Documentation and user guide finalization

### Phase 4: Production Launch ‚è≥ Future
- Beta label removed after successful audit
- Full marketing and community expansion
- Long-term roadmap execution

## What This Means for Users

### Current Beta Users
- The Beta application is **fully functional** for testing
- Your $EMARK tokens can be staked in Beta contracts
- Rewards and voting are operational
- **Expect occasional updates** as we refine the system

### Risk Disclosure
While the Beta contracts are significantly more robust than Alpha:
- Beta is **live on mainnet** but still in testing phase
- Smart contracts are deployed and functional but pending external audit
- Use only funds you can afford to have locked during Beta testing
- The system is operational but may have undiscovered edge cases
- Always practice proper wallet security

## Future Stability

The Beta contracts are designed with **long-term stability** in mind:

- **Modular architecture** allows for upgrades without fund migration
- **Battle-tested patterns** used from established DeFi protocols  
- **Comprehensive testing** including edge cases and attack vectors
- **Community feedback** will guide future development decisions

## Acknowledgments

Thank you to all Alpha participants who helped us test and improve the Evermark protocol. Your feedback was invaluable in designing the Beta contracts to be more robust, efficient, and user-friendly.

The Alpha phase served its purpose as a **proof of concept** and **testing ground**. The Beta phase represents the **foundation for long-term success**.
